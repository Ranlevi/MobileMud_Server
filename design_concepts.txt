Game Design
- Client for sending inputs and displaying content only. All game
  logic is handled on the backend.
  - demo client assumes text input only
- The content sent to the client is 'smart': i.e., entities are indicated
  by type, allowing the client to display actions according to type.
- Game content creation should be flexable, to allow any to create new games 
  using existing types.
  - defined by loading a JSON when the engine boots. 
- Two basic modes: 
  - Adventure: users interact with the world, create stuff according
    to what's available.
  - Creative: users interactivly create the world.
    - creating rooms and npcs. modifying properties via 'modify room.name' etc.
    - set/release ownership of rooms and objects.
  The two can be in the same game, but in different zones. 
- Type system is heirachical: 
- BaseType -> Room (has entities and objects)
           -> Object (inanimate objects)
           - Entity (has inventory, slots, health, damage) -> User
                                                           -> NPC
- Messages are sent async. Game has a 1 sec tick for entities.
- Development phases:
  - Basic World, single user moving around. look command.
    - changing client backgroud dynamically.
    - assigning typography according to type.   
    - saving and loading users.
  - Add objects and basic interactions: look, get, drop, hold, use.
    - Add inventory, slots to user.
  - Add NPCs and basic interactions: look, say. user sees what npc does.
  - Add combat system: kill
    - handle damage, death (corpse is an entity)
  - Add object creation: create (based on objects in inventory)
  - Add economy: coins, player wallet. buy/sell from inventory to npc.
  - add inter-user interactions: tell. 
  - Add tests
-There is a process of discovery happening for players on the planet. We need millions
of rooms, so probably a random romm generator with diferent bioms, like
minecraft.
-Quests will lead to the discovery of the story's apex. We ask the
players to keep it a secret from others. It won't work but will create
better cohesion with the players who take the game seriously. 
- Going deeper into the planet makes it more dangeours, thus creating 
a natural leveling/zoning system.
- Composition is key. Keep mechanis simple, and build with them.
- The economy is based on raw materials mined/found in the deeper levels.
  - the basic 'source' of new value are the materials. It has a natural
    feedback loop: more players = more mining = more value.
  - This casues inflation, so we need a sink to remove value from the game to
    prevent the coin being less and less valuable. 
    Two sinks: one is player growth, which creates demand for coin and thus
    fights inflation. The other is items being 
    broken/vanishing, which removes value from the game.
  - We can create a link between the number of new players in the game
    to the rate of new mateial discovery, rate of decay of items.
- Users will have no classes/gender: only self description and items owned.
  - Curiosity will be awarded with new recipies for creating unique and helpful
    items.
- Recipe book will use the concept of chained messages: messages with a 
  next/back button (or next/back commands). 
  This will allow short messages that will not force the user to read loading
  messages, which are equal to 'being blind'. 
- We want to engage the user's imagination, to make them 'see' the world in their
  mind's eye. So we ned to create strong signals for linking the text to 'mental
  pictures'. 
    - Backgroud color of the chat interface.
    - Messages boxes: different colors, border thickness and color,
      shapes, whitespace.
    - Typography for the text.
  This will not be random, but will have some intenral logic.
-Conceptual architecture:
  - A tick loop will run a world simulation. 
  - Use intearctions are asynchronous. To allow them to affect the world
    we implement a queue with scheduled events ('tick containers' for 
    current tick, tick+1, etc) so we can influence future events 
    by modifing them. (e.g a dog is scheduled to bark in 4 ticks. If the 
    user pets the dod, the barking is canceled/modified.)
- Each entity/item has it's own internal state which it
  operates independantly. The simulation takes care of
  interactions between items (e.g. battles)
